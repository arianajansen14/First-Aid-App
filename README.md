# First-Aid-App Collaboration Guide

JOEL DID A CHANGE!!!!!! AND ANOTHER

## How to set up this project on your Mac

### 1. Clone the repository

Open Terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/arianajansen14/First-Aid-App.git

(just paste this in hehe)

### 2. Open the project in Xcode

cd First-Aid-App open try2.xcodeproj

Xcode will launch the full project.

## Collaboration workflow

### Before you start coding:

git pull

### After you finish coding:

git add . git commit -m "describe what you changed" git push

All of us follow the same steps to keep the code updated.

## Important notes

- Do NOT add large video files (100MB+)
- Do NOT commit DerivedData, build folders, or .xcuserdata (gitignore handles this)
- If something breaks, message Ariana :)
